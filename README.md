## About

**Clean, Simple, Elegant**
*Clean Thesis* is a LaTeX style for thesis documents, developed for my diploma thesis (Diplomarbeit). The style can be understood as my personal compromise — a typical clean looking scientific document combined and polished with minor beautifications.

The design of this *Clean Thesis* style is inspired by user guide documents from Apple Inc.

Note: If you are looking for an exact and correct style regarding typographic rules, please have a look at the "[Classic Thesis Style](see http://www.miede.de/#classicthesis)".

**Donation = Postcard**
Based on the idea of André Miede: If you like the *Clean Thesis* style I would be very pleased about a donation in the form of a POSTCARD. You can find my address at the *Clean Thesis* [website](http://cleanthesis.der-ric.de/) as well as in the [documentation](doc/cleanthesis-doc.pdf). I am going to collect all postcards and exhibit them at the website I mentioned.

**Idea and Inspiration**
The idea of providing my customized style for thesis documents passed through my mind while writing my own thesis. Motivated and inspired by the superb "[Classic Thesis Style](http://www.miede.de/#classicthesis)" by André Miede (thanks to André for doing a great job) I decided to collect all design and style related functionality in a separate LaTeX style and provide this style to other thesis writers.
